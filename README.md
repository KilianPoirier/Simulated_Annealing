# Simulated_Annealing

This project is about solving the number partitioning problem using simulated annealing. Simulated annealing is a classical metaheuristic used to find approximate solutions to optimisation problems in a large search space. It uses stochastic sampling to mimic the way materials cool down to more stable and ordered configuration.
The proposed solution is written in python.
